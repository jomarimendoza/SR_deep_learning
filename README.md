# Super Resolution via Deep Learning using Deep and Shallow Networks
Based on [End-to-End Image Super-Resolution via Deep and Shallow Convolutional Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.07680)

Modifications of Feature extraction and Reconstruction is implemented. The following networks run on 150 epochs with decaying learning rate. The illustration of the network is shown below.
